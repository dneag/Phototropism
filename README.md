This program is a plug-in for Autodesk Maya.  It is designed to test a simulation of plants' tendancy to grow towards light.  It creates a 3D cubic grid, with each unit storing a density level.  Block points corresponding to locations on a tree can then be added to the grid, increasing the density of the 
units they fall in, which in turn affects the direction of the vectors stored in units below.  Plants on the grid can see these vectors and use them to determine
which direction they should grow.
